/* Resource provider behind a workspace handle (workspace-resource-plane
 * proposal, Phase 1).
 *
 * The whole server assumes today that it runs as the user, on the user's host,
 * in the user's working tree: file tools open absolute paths directly. To let
 * aimee-server run detached (e.g. in a container) the proposal routes file/exec
 * access through a pluggable provider selected per workspace:
 *
 *   - `shared`   (co-located / bind-mount): direct filesystem on the server
 *                host. The default; preserves today's behavior with zero
 *                overhead. This is the only provider implemented in Phase 1.
 *   - `detached` (marshalled): the same primitives carried over /v1. Not yet
 *                implemented; resolving it falls back to `shared` for now.
 *
 * The provider is a NARROW boundary: it performs only raw, already-resolved
 * I/O. All policy — path resolution, `proposal:` handling, validation, the
 * parent-worktree write guard, line/offset formatting, diff/slop shaping —
 * stays ABOVE the provider in the caller, so it is identical for every
 * provider and `shared` compiles to "the same thing we do now." */
