/* workspace_mirror — the `detached` mirror tier (workspace-resource-plane §3).
 *
 * When aimee-server is truly remote (no bind-mount, no client filesystem), it
 * holds a server-side **bare mirror** of the workspace, seeded by `git fetch`
 * from the client-reported `vcs.remote` at the client-reported `head`. The
 * client's uncommitted diff is applied on top to reconstruct an equivalent
 * tree. This module owns the mirror lifecycle (seed / update) and — the part
 * AC #5 turns on — **drift detection**: client head vs server mirror head is
 * classified and surfaced, never silently merged.
 *
 * git invocation is injected (a function pointer) so the core is testable
 * without shelling out, and so production can route it through the workspace
 * provider / forge-credential exec env. */
